MultiUser application
1. Users can have multiple roles: USER and ADMIN.
2. The database used is PostgreSQL.
3. The parameters being taken from the user are first name, last name, email, and password.
4. In order to register we send a POST request via Postman with the details.
5. When we login with our email and password, our account is enabled and we are able to log in.
6. The email and password hash code are saved in the database for the session.
7. When we stop the application the data cannot be retrieved.
